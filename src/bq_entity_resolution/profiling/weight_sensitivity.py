"""Weight sensitivity analysis: post-run diagnostics for weight tuning.

Generates SQL to analyze how each comparison contributes to match decisions,
enabling data-driven weight adjustments instead of trial-and-error.

Three analysis types:
1. Contribution analysis — which comparisons drove actual matches
2. Threshold sweep — match counts at different threshold values
3. Weight impact — how changing each weight affects match count
